usage:
  version: 2.1
  # Welcome to Ship's CircleCI support! First add the orb reference. You can find the latest version at https://github.com/ship-public/ship-orb
  orbs:
    ship: ship-public/ship-orb@x.y.z

  jobs:
    build:
      docker:
        - image: your-image
      steps:
        # Put this step first to let Ship know your job has started. Make sure to set the "completed" flag to false
        - ship/notify:
            completed: "false"
        - all_of_your_job_commands
        # And put this step again at the end of the build for when the run is complete - note no ':' at the end of the command name
        # if not specifying any params
        - ship/notify

  workflows:
    your-workflow:
      jobs:
        - build:
            # Typically you'll want to put your SHIP_API_KEY environment variable in a CircleCI Context,
            # and reference the context name here. Alternatively you can use a project-scope environment variable.
            # If you put it in a project-scope variable then no further change is needed to your project config file.
            context:
              - org-global
